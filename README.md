## GameOfLife

A [Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) simple implementation using Python, PyQT5, QTDesigner and convolution 
to manage the state succession mechanism.

## Motivation
This is a programming assignment for the HCI 2020-2021 course where it will be implemented the Game of Life, along with a
complete and polished Graphical User Interface to control the simulation with various features that will be described later.\
This project focuses on **functionality**, **code hygene**, **correctness**, **completeness** and **extra features** using interface programming **best practices** (such as MVC) so the application's overall look it's not a central aspect.

## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features implemented
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Credits
